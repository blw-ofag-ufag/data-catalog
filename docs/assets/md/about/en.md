# What is a Data Catalog?

A data catalog works similarly to a library catalog but is designed for digital information rather than books. It provides a centralized overview of an organization's data products, allowing users to quickly identify what data exists, where it is stored, who is responsible for it, and how they can access it.

# Why is this Relevant for Us?

The Federal Office for Agriculture (FOAG) is committed to promoting a multifunctional, value-adding agricultural and food sector that ensures food security for the Swiss population.
In doing so, many different types of data are collected, created, managed, processed, assessed, and published. These data serve as the basis for decision-making for various FOAG tasks.

Data come in many forms: from simple Excel sheets to complex databases. Some data relate to individuals and thus carry security risks; other data don't need protection but instead are meant to be publicly available.
Certain data might pertain to milk production, while others address nitrogen losses in agriculture.

With this constantly growing volume of data, it is essential for FOAG to provide a tool that allows for clear and structured data management.
This is fundamentally the goal of a comprehensive and up-to-date data catalog.
As a result, it directly contributes to adherence to the principles of the [digitalization strategy](https://digiagrifood.ch/digiknowhow/digitalisierungsstrategie), such as *Once Only*, *Open by Default*, *Security & Privacy by Default*, and *Innovation First*.

For FOAG as a whole and individual users, the data catalog ensures that:

- data are easily discoverable and understandable,
- data governance and compliance rules are followed,
- data can be reused multiple times, thus avoiding redundancies.

Consequently, the data catalog can significantly enhance collaboration, efficiency, and transparency.

# What are the Objectives of this Data Catalog?

The data catalog aims to achieve several objectives simultaneously:

1. **Metadata Management:** Allow users to capture and edit metadata.
2. **Centralized Data Discovery:** Facilitate understanding and access to data for all members of the organization. By examining metadata, users can determine if the data meet specific business requirements regarding quality, timeliness, and granularity.
3. **Enhancing Collaboration:** Promote collaboration by clearly indicating who is responsible for certain data or who can answer related questions.
4. **Improving Interoperability:** Reveal core and reference data so they can be quickly located and integrated when developing new IT systems.
5. **Synchronization with Other Data Portals:** Serve as a unified solution for managing FOAG metadata, with certain metadata being shared on national data portals such as [i14y](https://www.i14y.admin.ch/), [opendata.swiss](https://opendata.swiss/), or [geocat](https://www.geocat.ch/datahub), thus ensuring metadata quality across all downstream catalogs.
6. **Data Governance:** Assist in implementing FOAG's data governance practices, including assigning responsible persons for all datasets.
7. **Compliance with Legal Regulations:** Ensure compliance with legal requirements, particularly the [Data Protection Act (DSG)](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2022/491) and the [Information Security Act (ISG)](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2022/232).
8. **Digitalization Strategy:** Specifically contribute to the [digital transformation of the Swiss agri-food sector](https://digiagrifood.ch/digiknowhow/digitalisierungsstrategie) and support the vision of a data-driven sector.

# Who Benefits from a Data Catalog?

Different groups can benefit significantly from a data catalog, especially:

- **Data creators and owners:** Clarifying responsibilities and avoiding duplication.
- **Managers and decision-makers:** Quickly gaining an overview of existing data resources to support evidence-based strategies.
- **Technical teams:** Improving the planning and assessment of system integrations.
- **External stakeholders:** Finding publicly available data easily when needed.

# What does the Data Catalog contain?

The Data Catalog includes data products that are actively managed, regularly used, and provide ongoing value. Examples include:
- An Excel file with updated milk production figures per year
- A BI report (Power BI, SAP BO) tracking the development of the income situation
- A data warehouse table summarizing egg sales by retailer
- A machine learning model to predict pest risks based on weather and crop data
- A publicly accessible API service for real-time forecasting of expected crop yields per crop and region

Note: Raw data files, such as a retailerâ€™s original sales data for a specific period, should not be listed as separate data products. Instead, this raw data should be incorporated into an existing sales data product covering that period. Additionally, temporary or single-use files, like a one-off CSV created for quick analysis, are not considered relevant data products.

# Next Steps

We will refine the catalog further by engaging data owners, updating existing entries, and examining integration with other platforms.
Over time, we aim to establish this tool as an indispensable resource for internal and external partners, enabling data-driven innovation across all areas.
