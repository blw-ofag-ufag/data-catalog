# What is a data catalog?

A data catalog works similarly to a library catalog, but for digital information instead of books.
It provides a centralized overview of an organization's data products and allows users to quickly see what data is available, where it is stored, who is responsible for it, and how it can be accessed.

# Why is it relevant to us?

The FOAG also focuses on food security for the Swiss population.
In order to fulfill its mission and to enable the Swiss agricultural and food sector to handle resources and food in a sustainable way, our office creates, collects, manages, processes, evaluates and publishes *data*.
These data, along with the results of the analyses, serve as a basis for decision-making for the administration of, for example, agricultural policy, direct payments and research in the agricultural and food sectors.
It is therefore essential for the FOAG to provide itself with a tool that allows for the effective management of this data.
A complete and up-to-date data catalog directly contributes to compliance with the principles of our digitization strategy (https://blw-ofag-ufag.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DS/pages/22479169/Prinzipien) such as Once Only, Open by Default, Security & Privacy by default and Innovation first.
Our data catalog increases efficiency, promotes collaboration between teams, and ensures that everyone follows the same governance and compliance rules.
When data is easy to find and understand, it becomes easier to share responsibly and make informed decisions.

# Objectives of the data catalog

The main objectives of our data catalog are:
Make a tangible contribution to the [digitization strategy of the Swiss agricultural and food sector](https://digiagrifood.ch/digiknowhow/digitalisierungsstrategie)
Facilitate understanding and access to data for each member of the organization, according to their business needs and in compliance with their quality, timeliness and granularity criteria.
Facilitate collaboration between different units and improve communication channels for data-related questions
Improve interoperability by publishing master and reference data on national data portals ([I14Y](https://www.i14y.admin.ch/), [opendata.swiss](https://opendata.swiss/), etc.)

- Enable the organization to organize and manage metadata in a structured way
- Support the implementation of data governance
- Ensure compliance with legal standards and help improve data quality

# Who benefits?

All employees of the Federal Office for Agriculture can benefit from the data catalog:

- **Managers and decision-makers:** Quickly find the data they need for evidence-based strategies.
- **Data owners and analysts:** Know exactly who is responsible for different data sets and avoid duplicating work.
- **Technical teams:** Plan system integrations more efficiently and maintain data quality.
- **External stakeholders:** Access published data sets as needed and use them for research or community projects.

# Next steps

We will continue to refine the catalog by reaching out to data owners, updating existing entries, and exploring integrations with other platforms.
Over time, we aim to make this tool a go-to resource for internal and external partners, enabling data-driven innovation across the board.
