DigiAgriFoodCH Data Catalog
===========================

Welcome to the FOAG Data Catalog, a user-friendly yet robust repository that showcases our diverse data assets in one place. It brings together the best of modern data management: **interoperability**, **openness**, **collaboration**, and **ease of access**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> While the code and metadata are publicly available, some dataset links point to internal FOAG services and require the right credentials to access.

# ‚ú® Why is this data catalog special?

This data catalog directly supports the principles of DigiAgriFoodCH, Switzerland‚Äôs [digital strategy for the agri-food sector](https://digiagrifood.ch/digiknowhow/digitalisierungsstrategie) ‚Äî including Once Only, Open by Default, and Innovation First ‚Äî while ensuring seamless interoperability by aligning its metadata structure with both [I14Y](https://www.i14y.admin.ch/) and [opendata.swiss](https://opendata.swiss) standards for frictionless data exchange.
Each dataset includes clear ownership and provenance information, empowering data owners and analysts to collaborate more effectively and streamline data governance.
Ultimately, everyone benefits: managers and decision-makers make strategic calls faster with trusted data; technical teams simplify system integrations and metadata maintenance; and external stakeholders can easily access public datasets for research or community-driven projects.

# ‚ö° What are the key features?

1. **Intuitive frontend:** A user-friendly interface for browsing, filtering, and sorting datasets, making it simple to discover the information you need.
2. **Schema-based validation:** Each dataset is structured according to a robust JSON Schema, providing consistent quality and clarity throughout the catalog. *Note that data and schema are held on a [separate repository](https://github.com/blw-ofag-ufag/metadata).*
3. **Interoperability by design:** Metadata follows recognized standards and is compatible with both [I14Y](https://www.i14y.admin.ch/) and [opendata.swiss](https://opendata.swiss), ensuring seamless data exchange across platforms.
4. **Open source collaboration:** We welcome pull requests and community-driven improvements. Join our open source culture by sharing your ideas, reporting issues, or enhancing features for the benefit of all users.
